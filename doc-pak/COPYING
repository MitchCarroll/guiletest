"A woman was at the local convenience store, standing in the check out line to buy some groceries.
In front of her in line was a man in a suit, and at the checkout counter was a man in rags.
The man in rags was trying to buy food, but when the cashier counted his change, he came up short.
The man in the suit, seeing this, reached across the counter, and paid for the food for the man in rags. He then paid for his own purchase and left the store.
After buying her groceries, the woman hurried out into the parking lot, and caught the man in the suit before he got into his car.
"That was the kindest thing I think I've ever seen" she said; "Why did you do that?"
The man in the suit gave her a polite nod, and said:
"Ma'am, I don't need Ten Commandments; I only need one:"
"DON'T BE A DICK!"
